The code in this program was written only in ruby in the seed.rb pages_controller and view/pages/index.html.erb and search.html.erb
Also for styles I used bootstrap 4

The date.json is downloaded to the computer and is connected to the database in seeds.rb. The basic logic is in the pages_controller
